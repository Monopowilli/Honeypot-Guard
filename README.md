**Honeypot Guard** is an AI-driven security tool designed to protect crypto traders from honeypot scams, blacklisted tokens, and other malicious smart contract features. It works by instantly scanning token contracts, providing real-time alerts, and offering clear, actionable reports to ensure traders can make informed decisions without the need for technical expertise.

Built to work across **Solana** and **multi-chain** ecosystems, **Honeypot Guard** uses advanced AI to detect and warn users about potential scams and risks before they make a trade.

- **AI-Powered Token Scanning** – Detects risky contracts, including honeypots, excessive taxes, and minting vulnerabilities in real-time.
- **Real-Time Alerts** – Sends instant notifications to your **Telegram** or **Discord** for immediate action when a risky token is detected.
- **Blacklist Monitoring** – Identifies tokens that have blacklist mechanisms or restrictions that could prevent you from selling.
- **Multi-Chain Compatibility** – Supports **Solana**, **Ethereum**, and other major blockchains to ensure broad coverage.
- **No Technical Expertise Required** – Easy-to-understand reports that require no coding or contract reading knowledge.
- **Telegram/Discord Integration** – Protect your community by setting up real-time alerts in group chats.
