# Fixify - AI-Powered Smart Contract Security 

![Fixify Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exilium-Labs/Fixify/refs/heads/main/Banner.png)

**Fixify** is an AI-driven security engine designed to **detect, analyze, and patch vulnerabilities** in smart contracts. Built for **Solana and multi-chain ecosystems**, Fixify enhances security by providing **automated audits, real-time threat detection, and AI-assisted code fixes**.

## **Features**
- **AI-Based Vulnerability Detection** – Identifies weaknesses in smart contract code in real-time.
- **Automated Security Patching** – Suggests and applies secure fixes without manual intervention.
- **On-Chain Security Oracle** – Provides decentralized security scoring and auditing for smart contracts.
- **Multi-Chain Compatibility** – Supports **Ethereum, Solana, and other major blockchains**.
- **Permissionless & Non-Custodial** – Users retain full control over their smart contracts.
